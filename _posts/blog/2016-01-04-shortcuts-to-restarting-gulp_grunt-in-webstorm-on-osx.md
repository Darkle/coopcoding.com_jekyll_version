When developing with Webstorm, I usually find myself restarting gulp tons of times throughout the day, so I figured why not automate that a bit with a shortcut.

I set up [Better Touch Tool](http://www.boastr.net) to do the following: 

* On Control+g, focus Webstorm
* Then trigger the Control+Tab keys to bring up the switcher in Webstorm ![Webstorm Switcher](http://coopcoding.com/assets/images/blogpostimages/webstorm-switcher.png)
* Then trigger 8 key to select the terminal panel (I prefer running gulp from the terminal panel rather than it's own panel)
* Then trigger Control+c twice to exit gulp/grunt/node
* Then paste the text "gulp" in to the terminal panel
* Then trigger the Enter key

Here is a screenshot of it in Better Touch Tool:
