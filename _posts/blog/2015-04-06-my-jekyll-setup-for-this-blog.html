<p>title: My Jekyll Setup For This Blog
date: 2015-04-06 12:46:26</p>

<h2>tags: [Jekyll, Alfred]</h2>

<p>So I wanted to set up a coding blog I decided on using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> because itâ€™s relatively easy to set up and thereâ€™s tons of good info &amp; tutorials on the web. I briefly played around with <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and although the documentation on the site is really good, I didnâ€™t find much in the way of tutorials and articles from 3rd-party sites, so I stuck with Jekyll.</p>

<h3>Blog Structure</h3>

<p>For the site structure, I wanted it to be <code>coopcoding.com/projects/projectname/</code> and <code>coopcoding.com/blog/blog post title/</code>. This turned out to be a bit more difficult than I first envisioned. The <code>coopcoding.com/blog/blog post title/</code> was fairly easy to set up, but <code>coopcoding.com/projects/projectname/</code> took a bit of work.</p>

<p>At first I thought I would use the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/">default</a> way of creating pages and just stick them in the <code>coopcoding.com/projects/</code> folder, but unfortunately there is currently (<small><small>jekyll 2.5.3</small></small>) no way to iterate through all the pages in a directory. You can use collections or add data to the data directory, but these won&rsquo;t really work with the default pagination.</p>

<p>What I ended up doing was creating only blog posts and giving them either a &ldquo;blog&rdquo; category or a &ldquo;projects&rdquo; category. Then I used tags for if I wanted to show a grouping of posts or projects, e.g. if I was creating a blog post or a project about a chrome extension, in the yaml front matter for that post I would write something like:</p>

<h2>``` yaml</h2>

<p>title:  &ldquo;My Chrome Extension Project&rdquo;
date:   2015-02-15 10:14:35
tags:
  -Chrome Extension
  -Browser</p>

<h2>summary: &ldquo;This is the summary for the chrome extension project&rdquo;</h2>

<p>```</p>

<p>Then in my _config.yml I put the following:</p>

<p>``` yaml
permalink: /:categories/:title</p>

<h2>defaults:</h2>

<pre><code>scope:
  path: "blog"
  type: "posts"
values:
  layout: "post"
  category: "blog"
</code></pre>

<p>  -
    scope:
      path: &ldquo;projects&rdquo;
      type: &ldquo;posts&rdquo;
    values:
      layout: &ldquo;project&rdquo;
      category: &ldquo;projects&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>The <code>permalink: /:categories/:title</code> tells jekyll to spit out all the posts in the <code>_posts</code> folder and take what category they are (in this case either a blog or project) and create subfolders in the output directory of <code>coopcoding.com/projects/</code> &amp; <code>coopcoding.com/blog/</code> and generate all the blog posts in those subdirectories for each category.</p>

<p>Then I created an index.html page inside of the <code>/projects/</code> folder and inside of the <code>/blog/</code> folder. These were so that when a user visited <code>coopcoding.com/projects/</code>, they would be shown a list of the latest project pages, and when they visited <code>coopcoding.com/blog/</code>, they would be shown a list of the latest blog posts.</p>

<p>Here are screenshots of my Jekyll folder structure to better explain it:</p>

<p><img src="http://coopcoding.com/assets/images/blogpostimages/jek-folder-ss.png" alt="Jekyll Folder Structure" /></p>

<p>and a screenshot of Jekyll&rsquo;s output folder structure:</p>

<p><img src="http://coopcoding.com/assets/images/blogpostimages/jek-build-folder-structure.png" alt="Jekyll Output Folder Structure" /></p>

<p>Here is the html for the index.html in the <code>/projects/</code> folder: <a href="https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_layouts/project.html">https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_layouts/project.html</a></p>

<p>You can see I&rsquo;m looping over the <code>site.categories.projects</code> and listing each post in the &ldquo;projects&rdquo; category.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much the same for the html in the index.html in the <code>/blog/</code> folder: <a href="https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_layouts/project.html">https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_layouts/project.html</a></p>

<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>For generating &ldquo;tag&rdquo; pages, I used the code and process listed <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/">here</a>. You can see the tag pages output in the screenshot of Jekyll&rsquo;s output folder structure above.</p>

<h3>Blog &amp; Project Layouts</h3>

<p>Obviously I wanted to have different layouts for the blog post and project posts, so I used the following in my <code>_config.yml</code>:</p>

<p>``` yaml</p>

<h2>defaults:</h2>

<pre><code>scope:
  path: "blog"
  type: "posts"
values:
  layout: "post"
  category: "blog"
</code></pre>

<p>  -
    scope:
      path: &ldquo;projects&rdquo;
      type: &ldquo;posts&rdquo;
    values:
      layout: &ldquo;project&rdquo;
      category: &ldquo;projects&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>This tells Jekyll that for posts in that end up in the path <code>coopcoding.com/blog/</code> and are of the type &ldquo;posts&rdquo; that they are all in the category of &ldquo;blog&rdquo; and should use the layout &ldquo;post&rdquo;. The layout of &ldquo;post&rdquo; corresponds to the <a href="https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_layouts/post.html">post.html</a> in the <code>_layouts directory</code>. It then tells Jekyll that for posts in that end up in the path <code>coopcoding.com/projects/</code> and are of the type &ldquo;posts&rdquo; that they are all in the category of &ldquo;projects&rdquo; and should use the layout &ldquo;project&rdquo;. The layout of &ldquo;post&rdquo; corresponds to the <a href="https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_layouts/project.html">project.html</a> in the <code>_layouts directory</code>.</p>

<p>You can also see my complete <code>_config.yml</code> here: <a href="https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_config.yml">https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version/blob/master/_config.yml</a></p>

<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting">Pygments</a> is the default syntax highlighter for Jekyll. It&rsquo;s pretty good, but I didn&rsquo;t really like the syntax that you have to use for code blocks:</p>

<p>{% raw  %}</p>

<pre><code>{% highlight ruby %}

def foo

  puts 'foo'

end

{% endhighlight %}
</code></pre>

<p>{% endraw %}</p>

<p>Luckily, the Kramdown <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#kramdown">markdown interpreter in Jekyll supports</a> Github Flavoured Markdown, specifically the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#syntax-highlighting">code blocks</a>. With this enabled, a code block like this:</p>

<pre><code>``` ruby

def print_hi(name)

  puts "Hi, #{name}"

end

print_hi('Tom')

#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

```
</code></pre>

<p>will be render into this HTML:</p>

<p>``` markup</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
</code></pre>


<p>```</p>

<p>For the actual syntax highlighting, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get rouge to generate line numbers, so I used <a href="http://prismjs.com/">prism.js</a>. The prism.js output looks great and I figure so long as the javascript is at the bottom of the page and not blocking anything loading it should be fine and wont annoy people viewing the page. On the <a href="http://prismjs.com/download.html">prism.js download page</a> you can pick and choose what languages to support, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Prism checks any <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements on the page for the class <code>"language-foo"</code>, where &ldquo;foo&rdquo; is the name of the language that&rsquo;s in the code block.</p>

<p>One thing that did trip me up a bit with prism.js was that in order to use the line number feature, you need to give the code block a class of <code>line-numbers</code>, which isn&rsquo;t too big of a deal as I could just add the element attribute to the end of each code block like this:</p>

<pre><code>``` ruby

def print_hi(name)

  puts "Hi, #{name}"

end

print_hi('Tom')

#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

```

{: .line-numbers}
</code></pre>

<p>But that seemed like a bit of a hassle, so I went ahead and looked in the kramdown source files that were installed on my computer; I&rsquo;m on a mac, so the kramdown folder was in <code>/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/2.2.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/kramdown-1.6.0/lib/kramdown/</code>. From that folder, I went to the <code>parser/kramdown/codeblock.rb</code> file, then opened it and changed line 44 from</p>

<p><code>ruby
el.attr['class'] = "language-#{lang}" unless lang.empty?
</code></p>

<p>to</p>

<p><code>ruby
el.attr['class'] = "language-#{lang} line-numbers" unless lang.empty?
</code></p>

<p>Now every code block has the class of <code>line-numbers</code> added to it as well. ðŸ˜€</p>

<p>After implementing prism.js, I noticed that there seemed to be an extra blank line added to the code blocks. This seems to be a <a href="https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/issues/403">known bug</a>, so I just downloaded the development version of prism.js (aka the unminified source) and changed the code to what is listing in the change <a href="https://github.com/haarg/prism/commit/2e7409189114e14b940fc80fe8d22c0072114f48">here</a> as it has not yet been merged into the official prism.js code yet.</p>

<h3>Plugins &amp; Building Locally</h3>

<p>Because Github pages only supports a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/">few plugins</a> and I wanted to use <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/">this</a> tag plugin, I had to set it up so that Jekyll built the site locally, then I pushed that built version to my <a href="https://github.com/Darkle/darkle.github.io">darkle.github.io repository</a>. Doing this manually is a bit of a pain, but I stumbled on to <a href="http://spinhalf.net/2015/01/04/getting-started-with-a-jekyll-blog/">this neat article</a> about using an <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> workflow to make things faster and easier.</p>

<p>Basically it allows you to create a new Jekyll post (including front-matter) with an shortcut in Alfred.</p>

<p>My Alfred workflow shortcuts look like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://coopcoding.com/assets/images/blogpostimages/Jek-Alfred-ss2.png" alt="Jekyll Alfred Screenshot" /></p>

<p>When I select a new blog post it runs the following bash commands:</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>Adjust these variables to your installation:</h1>

<p>sitedir=/Users/username/Coding/Projects/coopcoding.com/jekyll_files/
editor=&ldquo;MacDown.app&rdquo;
extension=markdown</p>

<p>filename=$(echo $sitedir/_posts/blog/$(date +&lsquo;%Y-%m-%d&rsquo;)-{query}.$extension | sed -e &rsquo;s, ,-,g' | tr &lsquo;[:upper:]&rsquo; &lsquo;[:lower:]&rsquo;)</p>

<h2>cat &lt;<EOT >> $filename</h2>

<p>title: {query}
date: $(date +&lsquo;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&rsquo;)</p>

<h2>tags:[]</h2>

<p>EOT
open -a &ldquo;$editor&rdquo; $filename
```</p>

<p>What this does is takes the title I gave it in Alfred and prepends the current date to that, then it creates a new file in the <code>_posts/blog/</code> directory and uses that title and date as the file name (Jekyll needs a <code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code> format for post file names). Then it adds the default front-matter for blog posts, plus the blog title that was specified by me in Alfred. It then opens that file in my markdown editor <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/">Macdown.app</a>.</p>

<p>When I select a new project post it runs the following bash commands:</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>Adjust these variables to your installation:</h1>

<p>sitedir=/Users/username/Coding/Projects/coopcoding.com/jekyll_files/
editor=&ldquo;Whiskey.app&rdquo;
extension=markdown</p>

<p>filename=$(echo $sitedir/_posts/projects/$(date +&lsquo;%Y-%m-%d&rsquo;)-{query}.$extension | sed -e &rsquo;s, ,-,g' | tr &lsquo;[:upper:]&rsquo; &lsquo;[:lower:]&rsquo;)</p>

<h2>cat &lt;<EOT >> $filename</h2>

<p>title: {query}
date: $(date +&lsquo;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&rsquo;)
tags: []</p>

<h2>summary:</h2>

<p>EOT
open -a &ldquo;$editor&rdquo; $filename
```</p>

<p>which is pretty much the same except it creates the post in the <code>_posts/projects/</code> folder and it has a slightly different front-matter.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Build And Push To Github&rdquo; runs the following bash commands:</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>Adjust these variables to your installation:</h1>

<p>export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH</p>

<p>JEKYLL_BLOG_DIRECTORY=&ldquo;/Users/username/Coding/Projects/coopcoding.com/jekyll_files/&rdquo;</p>

<p>DATE_TIME=$(date +&lsquo;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&rsquo;)</p>

<p>cd $JEKYLL_BLOG_DIRECTORY
git add .
git commit -a -m &ldquo;Post $DATE_TIME&rdquo;</p>

<h1>check if there were any new files made on github</h1>

<p>git pull &ndash;rebase</p>

<h1>push to github</h1>

<p>git push origin master</p>

<p>terminal-notifier -title &ldquo;Git Push for CoopCoding Jekyll Files Done&rdquo; -message &ldquo;&rdquo; -open &ldquo;https://github.com/Darkle/coopcoding.com_jekyll_version&rdquo;</p>

<p>jekyll build</p>

<p>terminal-notifier -title &ldquo;Jekyll Built Static Files&rdquo; -message &ldquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>STATIC_BLOG_DIRECTORY=&ldquo;/Users/username/Coding/Projects/coopcoding.com/darkle.github.io/&rdquo;</p>

<p>cd $STATIC_BLOG_DIRECTORY
git add .
git commit -a -m &ldquo;Post $DATE_TIME&rdquo;
git push origin master</p>

<p>terminal-notifier -title &ldquo;Git Push for CoopCoding Static Files Done&rdquo; -message &ldquo;&rdquo; -open &ldquo;https://github.com/Darkle/darkle.github.io&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>This adds all files/new files to the git repository in my jekyll files folder. Then commits the change(s) to the repository with a message that includes the date and time. Then it checks to see if there were any changes made from somewhere else, then it pushes to github.</p>

<p>Next, jekyll builds the static site, then the script adds files to the static git repository, commits and pushes to github.</p>

<p>Originally I was going to use the default notifier for OSX in the bash script to notify me when the git pushes and the jekyll build was finished but it wasn&rsquo;t working for me, so I used this library insted: <a href="https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier">https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier</a>. Note: the bash shell jekyll uses didn&rsquo;t seem to load my default <code>.bash_profile</code> file automatically, so I had to manually put in <code>export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH</code> so that it could see the terminal-notifier library I had installed via homebrew.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Open Blog Post&rdquo; runs the following bash commands:</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>Adjust these variables to your installation:</h1>

<p>sitedir=/Users/username/Coding/Projects/coopcoding.com/jekyll_files/
extension=markdown</p>

<p>IFS=$&lsquo;\n&rsquo;</p>

<p>files=$(find $sitedir/<em>posts/blog -iname &ldquo;*.$extension&rdquo; | xargs ls -r |perl -MHTML::Entities -CS -pe'$</em> = encode_entities($_, q{&amp;&lt;>&ldquo;&lsquo;\&rsquo;&lsquo;})&rsquo;)</p>

<p>echo &ldquo;&lt;?xml version=&lsquo;1.0&rsquo;?><items>&rdquo;
for file in ${files}; do
    echo &ldquo;<item uuid='file' arg='${file}' type='file'>&rdquo;
    echo &ldquo;<title>$(basename ${file})</title>&rdquo;
    echo &ldquo;<subtitle>${file}</subtitle>&rdquo;
    echo &ldquo;<icon type='fileicon'>${file}</icon>&rdquo;
    echo &ldquo;</item>&rdquo;
done
echo &ldquo;</items>&rdquo;
fi
```</p>

<p>What this does is iterate through all of the files in the <code>_posts/blog</code> directory and then list them in Alfred. When you select which file you want, Alfred then opens that file in the markdown editor.</p>
